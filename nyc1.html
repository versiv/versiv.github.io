I’ve not flown in years, and have avoided major interstate travel since the pandemic…

Everything seems so frenetic, so empty-of-substance and over-torqued with protocol. Living in a constant state of mindless panic, self-constructed and self-deluded. 

We scurry around from sign post to sign post, in need of direction but listening for none. What are we without a lead, a leash, some bullring through our nose for the pace-maker to tug as we abandon our gut-compass and sacrifice our morality for the next vogue status quo…

It’s unsurprising how much a ginger-ale and pack of crackers can level-out the mood of a plane crammed with passengers. 

There’s no real reason for me to write, as in the face of the moment I am at a loss for real words… What is “real”? What is anything aside from an arbitrary sense of systematic deterioration, a way to conduct the traffic of linguistic rush-hour, to make some sense to the senseless, or to sense less? 

Writing is supposed to be cathartic, empowering, a window to the inner-mono-poly-dialogue that creeps up in one’s belly, deep down viscera. 

It’s difficult to find inspiration on a plane, where the psycho-sonicsphere is riddled with inconsistent 909 crashes, wailings of unhappy babes, and so forth. The lack of consistent connection to the outside world is claustrophobic, wherein the wi-fi portal may the only portal to the grounded reality.

Crinoid(s)



face, faces, facades, everywhere

every turn, every turn

streaming by, screaming, dry eyes and exasperated features

is everyone everywhere dying? 

Side-eyeing? 

Side-eyeing




everyone, everywhere, 

everything, all the same, all the time




can you really blame them? For the cold night’s jazz licks leaving flights of stairs and alleycats’ treacherous lairs, broken bottles ensnare a filter of great malaise

those were the days

those were the days

what do repetitions mean aside from a gentle glean, 

cleave clean

like meat-markets marked down to embark 

dream-lucid of the root bark

too much, too much, 

too what do we discuss ?  ? ??   ? 

steel-toed fancies

I wish much disgust

terminal-gate embossings 

to what flight will you desire what height

how how high high \\\
?


the advertisements around the city were unreal, 4th walls nary a thing but allow easement of corrupt cortexical traumas be deep-seated in the collective attention-span of the local population. 

Massive iDevice billboards with photographs of arrays of megapixel evil eyes ensconced in the panoptic observation of a surveillance camera.

People too beautiful to engage in, eye-contact like primal retinal copulation from behind these paper masks…

something to consider:

olooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiolllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
